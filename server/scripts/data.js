      title: "How To Work with Strings in JavaScript By Tania Rascia",
      author: "Tania Rascia",
      body: 'Introduction\r\n      A string is a sequence of one or more characters that may consist of letters, numbers, or symbols. Strings in JavaScript are primitive data types and immutable, which means they are unchanging.\r\n      \r\n      As strings are the way we display and work with text, and text is our main way of communicating and understanding through computers, strings are one of the most fundamental concepts of programming to be familiar with.\r\n      \r\n      In this article, we\u2019re going to learn how to create and view the output of strings, how to concatenate strings, how to store strings in variables, and the rules of using quotes, apostrophes, and newlines within strings in JavaScript.\r\n      \r\n      Creating and Viewing the Output of Strings\r\n      In JavaScript, there are three ways to write a string \u2014 they can be written inside single quotes (\' \'), double quotes (\" \"), or backticks (` `). The type of quote used must match on both sides, however it is possible that all three styles can be used throughout the same script.\r\n      \r\n      Strings using double quotes and single quotes are effectively the same. As there is no convention or official preference for single- or double-quoted strings, all that matters is keeping consistent within project program files.\r\n      \r\n      \'This string uses single quotes.\';\r\n      \"This string uses double quotes.\";\r\n      The third and newest way to create a string is called a template literal. Template literals use the backtick (also known as a grave accent) and work the same way as regular strings with a few additional bonuses, which we will cover in this article.',

      title: "Understanding This, Bind, Call, and Apply in JavaScript",
      author: "Tania Rascia",
      body: 'The this keyword is a very important concept in JavaScript, and also a particularly confusing one to both new developers and those who have experience in other programming languages. In JavaScript, this is a reference to an object. The object that this refers to can vary, implicitly based on whether it is global, on an object, or in a constructor, and can also vary explicitly based on usage of the Function prototype methods bind, call, and apply.\r\n\r\n      Although this is a bit of a complex topic, it is also one that appears as soon as you begin writing your first JavaScript programs. Whether you\'re trying to access an element or event in the Document Object Model (DOM), building classes for writing in the object-oriented programming style, or using the properties and methods of regular objects, you will encounter this.\r\n      \r\n      In this article, you\'ll learn what this refers to implicitly based on context, and you\'ll learn how to use the bind, call, and apply methods to explicitly determine the value of this.\r\n      \r\n      Implicit Context\r\n      There are four main contexts in which the value of this can be implicitly inferred:\r\n      \r\n      the global context\r\n      as a method within an object\r\n      as a constructor on a function or class\r\n      as a DOM event handler\r\n      Global\r\n      In the global context, this refers to the global object. When you\'re working in a browser, the global context is window. When you\'re working in Node.js, the global context is global.',

      title: "Alfred North Whitehead’s Awe-Inspiring Focus",
      author: "Cal Newport",
      body: 'Alfred North Whitehead was an early 20th-century mathematician and philosopher. He\u2019s known, among many contributions, for his magisterial three-volume treatise, Principia Mathematica, which was written with Bertrand Russell and attempted to reduce all of mathematics to implications of a master set of logical axioms (Kurt G\u00F6del, of course, had other ideas about this particular endeavor).\r\n\r\n      Whitehead later turned his attention from mathematics toward the philosophy of science, and then on to metaphysics. In total, he published 23 books between 1898 and 1948.\r\n      \r\n      What does it take to produce cognitive output at such a high level? Bertrand Russell gives us a hint in the following scene from his autobiography:\r\n      \r\n      \u201C[Whitehead\u2019s] capacity for concentration on work was quite extraordinary. One hot summer\u2019s day, when I was staying with him at Grantchester, our friend Crompton Davies arrived and I took him into the garden to say how-do-you-do to his host. Whitehead was sitting writing mathematics. Davies and I stood in front of him at a distance of no more than a yard and watched him covering page after page with symbols. He never saw us, and after a time we went away with a feeling of awe.\u201D\r\n      \r\n      One of the things that worries me about the shoulder-shrugging manner in which our current culture is diminishing uninterrupted thinking is that I can\u2019t help but wonder how many potential modern Whiteheads, growing up in a world of fragmentation and connectivity-primacy, will never make it to writing their own masterpieces.',
