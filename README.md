MERN Stack Blog App
=========

> This is a personal blog application I created.  
Admin can CRUD posts and comments.
Users Registered/Signed In can comment (add/remove/edit) on posts. 

* Node.js/Express server
* MongoDB on Docker container for data persistence
* Mongoose to query database
* React Front-End (React-Router, Class based Components)
* Axios for client-side requests
* Token based Authentication (express-jwt / jsonwebtoken)
* Password-less authentication (currently link-to-visit upon sign in/register is printed via console, can be extended to email)

*Here are images of the blog-app (also in /blog-images/)*
